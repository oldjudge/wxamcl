#summary Documentation for inbuilt Lua Scripting

= Introduction =
This section contains the documentation for the client Lua interface.
= Details =
 You will find here a documentation of all scripting functions.
 Some general stuff:
  The global lua object is called 'wxamcl'. So all functions are called like wxaml.echo("Test"). You can leave the wxamcl-prefix and call the functions direct by their name.
  You can call scriptfunctions directly from the command line:
   ?wxamcl.echo("Test text", "red")
  You can call a whole scriptfile from the command line:
	#script("testscintilla.lua")
  If you want to use wxamlc.wait or wxamcl.waitfor to pause the script you need to use the '#tscript' command:
   #tscript("waitfor.lua")
  You can call a single function from a file:
   #func("functest.lua", "Test('Grün', 'red')")
